# Identify-a-Car-Model-with-Deep-Learning
Explore how to practice real world Data Science by collecting data, curating it and apply advance Deep Learning techniques to
create high quality models which can be deployed in Production.

# Data
- There are 4000 images of two of the popular cars (Swift and Wagonr) in India of make Maruti Suzuki with 2000 pictures belonging to
each model. The data is divided into training set with 2400 images , validation set with 800 images and test set with 800 images. 
- The data was randomized before splitting into training, test and validation set.
- The data was collected using a web scraper written in python. Selenium Library was used to load the full HTML page and then
Beautifulsoup library was used to extract and download images from HTML tags
- The data is hosted at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ajaykgp12/cars-wagonr-swift) which can be downloaded or you can 
also create a notebook directly on Kaggle and access data in your notebook.
